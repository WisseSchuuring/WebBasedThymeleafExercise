dibamidae.info=Dibamidae or blind skinks is a family of lizards \
characterized by their elongated cylindrical body \
and an apparent lack of limbs. Female dibamids \
are entirely limbless and the males retain small flap-like \
hind limbs, which they use to grip their partner during mating.\
They have a rigidly fused skull, lack pterygoid teeth and \
external ears. Their eyes are greatly reduced, and covered \
with a scale.
gecko.info=Geckos are small, mostly carnivorous lizards that have a \
wide distribution, found on every continent except Antarctica. \
Belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, geckos are found in \
warm climates throughout the world. They range from 1.6 to \
60 centimetres (0.6 to 23.6 inches).
lacertoidea.info=The Lacertidae are the family of the wall lizards, \
true lizards, or sometimes simply lacertas, which \
are native to Afro-Eurasia. It is a diverse family \
with at least 300 species in 39 genera. They represent \
the dominant group of reptiles found in Europe. The \
group includes the genus Lacerta, which contains some \
of the most commonly seen lizard (thus "true" lizard) \
species in Europe.
scincomorpha.info=Scincomorpha is an infraorder and clade of lizards including\
skinks (Scincidae) and their close relatives. These include\
the living families Cordylidae (girdled lizards),\
Gerrhosauridae (plated lizards), and Xantusiidae (night lizards),\
as well as many extinct taxa. Other roughly equivalent\
terms include the suborder Scinciformata, or the\
superfamily Scincoidea, though different authors use\
these terms in a broader or more restricted usage\
relative to true skinks. They first appear in the\
fossil record about 170 million years ago, during the \
Jurassic period. The phylogeny below follows that \
of Alifanov in 2016.
toxicofera.info=Toxicofera (Greek for "those who bear toxins") is a proposed\
clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes),\
Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards)\
and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons).\
Toxicofera contains about 4,600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant Squamata.\
It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as\
numerous related non-venomous species. There is little \
morphological evidence to support this grouping,\
 however it has been recovered by all molecular analyses as of 2012.
